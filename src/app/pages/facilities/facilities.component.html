            Root canal treatment is a treatment where the infected pulp of the
            tooth is removed and the inside of the tooth is carefully cleaned
            and disinfected which results in the elimination of the infection
            and protection of the tooth from further microbial infection. The
            root is filled with a rubber-like material called Gutta percha. Root
            canal treatment in our clinic is done by the NMC registered

          <p class="card-text text-secondary">
            The main objectives of gum disease and tooth treatment and cleaning
            are to promote reattachment of healthy gums to teeth, reduce
            swelling and inflammation, cleaning of the deep pockets, and reduce
            the risk of infection, and stop disease progression. The tooth is
            deep cleaned by an experienced Registered Dental hygienist and or
            NMC registered dentist. By having professional cleanings on a
            regular basis, you will help to protect and restore the health of
            your teeth and gums. We take every opportunity to improve your oral
            health and, when helpful, and will develop a cleaning strategy to
            promote optimal dental care.
